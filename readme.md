# Jordan Scrapes with ScrapingBee

This goes through examples of web scraping with ScrapingBee. It also compares speeds vs normal web requests and vs Luminati.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`.

You'll need a [ScrapingBee](https://www.scrapingbee.com?fpr=jordan-hansen52) API key for most of these functions. To do the function that tests [Luminati](https://brightdata.grsm.io/jordanhansen6276) you'll also need to set up an account with them.

 Then you'll want to take the `.sample.env`, replace the values and rename it to `.env`.


### Prerequisites

Tested on Node v16.13.2 and NPM v8.1.2

### Installing

After installing [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) you should be able to just run the following in the terminal.

```
npm i
```
